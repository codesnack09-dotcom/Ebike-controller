# This Arduino sketch is designed for a simple e-bike controller and includes the most commonly used features:
• Read throttle (potentiometer / sensor 0–5V)
• Read brake switch (brake cut-off)
• Read wheel hall sensor (for speed measurement)
• Monitor battery voltage (via ADC)
• Output PWM to motor driver / MOSFET (motor power control)
• Soft-start & safety cut-offs (low voltage / brake / overspeed)
• Debug output via Serial
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT — Safety & Legal Notice
• This is an educational example. Do not directly connect it to a motor or battery without proper protection. E-bike batteries operate at high voltage and current — mishandling is dangerous.
• Ensure your motor driver/ESC is compatible with the PWM output from Arduino, or use an interface such as a level shifter / limiter.
• Always follow traffic and safety regulations in your country.
# Required Components
• Arduino Uno / Nano
• Throttle: potentiometer 0–5V (or throttle sensor output) → analog pin A0
• Brake switch: pushbutton/switch → digital pin (internal pull-up enabled)
• Wheel hall sensor (pulses per revolution) → digital interrupt pin D2
• Battery voltage divider → analog pin A1 (must scale down <5V input to Arduino)
• PWM output to motor driver / ESC input → PWM pin (D3/D5/D6, etc.)
• Motor driver / ESC capable of handling your motor’s current and compatible with PWM
# Circuit Overview (conceptual)
• Throttle (middle wire) → A0
• Battery voltage divider → A1
• Hall sensor → D2 (interrupt pin)
• Brake switch → D4 (with pull-up or pull-down)
• PWM output → D3 (Timer2 PWM)
# Code Explanation
• Throttle: Read via ADC (A0). Mapped to PWM using a quadratic curve for smoother response.
• Brake: If pressed, PWM is cut off immediately. (Note: regenerative braking requires ESC hardware that supports it.)
• Hall sensor: Interrupt measures the time between pulses → converted to RPM. Adjust PULSES_PER_REV according to your sensor setup (1, 2, or more magnets).
• Battery: ADC reads from voltage divider; BATT_SCALE must match your divider ratio (Vbatt max / Vadc max). Includes low-voltage cut-off (BATT_CUTOFF_V) for battery safety.
• Safety: Immediate cut-off on overspeed, low battery, or brake press.
• PWM: Uses analogWrite() 8-bit (0–255). Ensure your ESC/motor driver can handle this signal.
# Tuning & Setup Tips
• Calibrate BATT_SCALE — measure the ADC output with a multimeter at full battery voltage.
• Set PULSES_PER_REV based on your wheel sensor (e.g., 2 magnets → PULSES_PER_REV = 2).
• Adjust MAX_RPM according to gearing and wheel size.
• Never connect the motor directly to Arduino PWM — always use a driver/ESC rated for your current.
• Add a current sensor (e.g., ACS712 or shunt + amplifier) for overcurrent protection.
• Implement ramping (soft-start) to reduce current spikes; this example uses a quadratic throttle curve, but you can also limit PWM step increase per cycle.
• Always use proper braking hardware (mechanical/electronic) — do not rely solely on software braking.

# 3. Arduino / ESP32 Example Code (PID Speed Control + Overcurrent + Eco/Sport)

# 4. Feature Explanation
1.	PID Speed Control – Automatically adjusts PWM to reach target RPM.
2.	Current Sensor & Cut-Off – Monitors motor current and disables PWM if overcurrent occurs.
3.	Eco/Sport Modes – Selectable via potentiometer or Bluetooth input; modifies throttle response.
4.	Throttle Curve – Adjustable multiplier: 0.6 for Eco, 1.0 for Sport.
 
# 5. MOSFET Driver Notes
•	PWM from Arduino/ESP32 drives the gate driver input.
•	Use MOSFETs rated for motor voltage/current.
•	Include flyback diodes and heatsinks to protect MOSFETs.
•	Current sensor can still feed Arduino for overcurrent cut-off.
 
#💡 Tip:
You can expand this system with:
•	Bluetooth app for RPM target and mode switching
•	Data logging of RPM/current/battery voltage
•	Soft start / ramping for smoother acceleration

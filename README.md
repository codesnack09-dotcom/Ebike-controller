# This Arduino sketch is designed for a simple e-bike controller and includes the most commonly used features:
‚Ä¢ Read throttle (potentiometer / sensor 0‚Äì5V)
‚Ä¢ Read brake switch (brake cut-off)
‚Ä¢ Read wheel hall sensor (for speed measurement)
‚Ä¢ Monitor battery voltage (via ADC)
‚Ä¢ Output PWM to motor driver / MOSFET (motor power control)
‚Ä¢ Soft-start & safety cut-offs (low voltage / brake / overspeed)
‚Ä¢ Debug output via Serial
# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚Äî Safety & Legal Notice
‚Ä¢ This is an educational example. Do not directly connect it to a motor or battery without proper protection. E-bike batteries operate at high voltage and current ‚Äî mishandling is dangerous.
‚Ä¢ Ensure your motor driver/ESC is compatible with the PWM output from Arduino, or use an interface such as a level shifter / limiter.
‚Ä¢ Always follow traffic and safety regulations in your country.
# Required Components
‚Ä¢ Arduino Uno / Nano
‚Ä¢ Throttle: potentiometer 0‚Äì5V (or throttle sensor output) ‚Üí analog pin A0
‚Ä¢ Brake switch: pushbutton/switch ‚Üí digital pin (internal pull-up enabled)
‚Ä¢ Wheel hall sensor (pulses per revolution) ‚Üí digital interrupt pin D2
‚Ä¢ Battery voltage divider ‚Üí analog pin A1 (must scale down <5V input to Arduino)
‚Ä¢ PWM output to motor driver / ESC input ‚Üí PWM pin (D3/D5/D6, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Motor driver / ESC capable of handling your motor‚Äôs current and compatible with PWM
# Circuit Overview (conceptual)
‚Ä¢ Throttle (middle wire) ‚Üí A0
‚Ä¢ Battery voltage divider ‚Üí A1
‚Ä¢ Hall sensor ‚Üí D2 (interrupt pin)
‚Ä¢ Brake switch ‚Üí D4 (with pull-up or pull-down)
‚Ä¢ PWM output ‚Üí D3 (Timer2 PWM)
# Code Explanation
‚Ä¢ Throttle: Read via ADC (A0). Mapped to PWM using a quadratic curve for smoother response.
‚Ä¢ Brake: If pressed, PWM is cut off immediately. (Note: regenerative braking requires ESC hardware that supports it.)
‚Ä¢ Hall sensor: Interrupt measures the time between pulses ‚Üí converted to RPM. Adjust PULSES_PER_REV according to your sensor setup (1, 2, or more magnets).
‚Ä¢ Battery: ADC reads from voltage divider; BATT_SCALE must match your divider ratio (Vbatt max / Vadc max). Includes low-voltage cut-off (BATT_CUTOFF_V) for battery safety.
‚Ä¢ Safety: Immediate cut-off on overspeed, low battery, or brake press.
‚Ä¢ PWM: Uses analogWrite() 8-bit (0‚Äì255). Ensure your ESC/motor driver can handle this signal.
# Tuning & Setup Tips
‚Ä¢ Calibrate BATT_SCALE ‚Äî measure the ADC output with a multimeter at full battery voltage.
‚Ä¢ Set PULSES_PER_REV based on your wheel sensor (e.g., 2 magnets ‚Üí PULSES_PER_REV = 2).
‚Ä¢ Adjust MAX_RPM according to gearing and wheel size.
‚Ä¢ Never connect the motor directly to Arduino PWM ‚Äî always use a driver/ESC rated for your current.
‚Ä¢ Add a current sensor (e.g., ACS712 or shunt + amplifier) for overcurrent protection.
‚Ä¢ Implement ramping (soft-start) to reduce current spikes; this example uses a quadratic throttle curve, but you can also limit PWM step increase per cycle.
‚Ä¢ Always use proper braking hardware (mechanical/electronic) ‚Äî do not rely solely on software braking.
